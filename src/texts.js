export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Write Only is my attempt at Yet Another Writing App®. I made it to test React Hooks. I was pleasantly surprised by the "useReducer" hook and how you can compose reducers to create new hooks.

Features:
- undo/redo
- automatic saving in localStorage
- works offline (thanks CRA)
